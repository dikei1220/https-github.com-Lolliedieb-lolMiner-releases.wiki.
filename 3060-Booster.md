After some time, investigation, it has been found a small door open to let to get better performance on the 3060 in Linux, it can go with or without riser and with or without any HDMI Dummy/Monitor. 
This 3060 Booster is nearly an increase of 50% to the actual know mining for the 3060. The investigation will continue to try to get the maximum possible performance for the miners. That 3060 Booster needs only some special drivers: Nvidia 460.39, it will also work with 460.32 and 455.45.01 . 
3060 Booster is trying to get always best performance... do not worry if you see a go momentary go down hashrate, lolMiner will autorecovery to get max performance again. Normally it takes around 5 minutes to get the stable Mhs.
It is really important to don’t change OC during mining, each time you change the OC, please you should restart the miner.
